## ðŸŽ¨ **Animation Guide & Tips**

### **Understanding Visual Elements**

#### **Color Coding System**
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Current state, errors, things being removed
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Target values, correct answers, things being kept
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Data points, reference lines, stable elements
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Highlighted elements, current focus
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Warnings, important information
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Advanced concepts, transformations

#### **Animation Speed Control**
```python
# Most animations have adjustable speed
# Look for these parameters in the code:
interval=2000    # Milliseconds between frames (slower)
interval=500     # Faster animation
repeat=True      # Loop animation
repeat=False     # Run once
```

#### **Interactive Elements**
- **Click and drag**: Some plots allow interaction
- **Keyboard controls**: Space to pause, arrow keys to navigate
- **Parameter sliders**: Adjust learning rates, features, etc.

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Animation Problems**
```python
# If animations are too fast/slow
plt.show(block=True)  # Wait for window close
time.sleep(2)         # Add delays between frames

# If plots don't appear
plt.ion()             # Turn on interactive mode
plt.show()            # Force display
plt.pause(0.1)        # Brief pause
```

#### **Performance Issues**
- Close previous plot windows before running new animations
- Reduce data points for smoother animations
- Use smaller figure sizes for better performance
