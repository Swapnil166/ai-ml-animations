3. **Experiment**: Change parameters and see what happens
4. **Connect Concepts**: Relate math to real-world meaning
5. **Take Breaks**: Let concepts sink in between sessions

### 🤔 If You Get Stuck
1. **Go Back to Visuals**: Use animations to build intuition
2. **Focus on Concepts**: Math follows understanding
3. **Use Analogies**: Hill climbing, ball rolling, etc.
4. **Ask "Why?"**: Understand the purpose of each step
5. **Practice**: Try with different datasets
