## üé® **Animation Development Guidelines**

### **Educational Principles**
1. **Visual First**: Show concepts before equations
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add details gradually
3. **Interactive Learning**: Allow experimentation
4. **Real Examples**: Use relatable, practical examples
5. **Clear Explanations**: Explain "why" not just "how"

### **Technical Standards**
```python
# Example animation structure
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import numpy as np

class ConceptAnimator:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        """Initialize with clear parameter explanations"""
        self.setup_visualization()
    
    def animate_step(self, frame):
        """Single animation frame with clear logic"""
        # Update visualization
        # Add educational annotations
        # Return updated elements
        
    def demonstrate_concept(self):
        """Main function with educational narrative"""
        print("üéì Learning [Concept Name]")
        print("=" * 50)
        # Explain what will be shown
        # Run animation
        # Summarize key learnings
```

### **Visual Design Guidelines**
- **Consistent Colors**: Use the established color scheme
- **Clear Labels**: All axes, legends, and annotations
- **Readable Fonts**: Appropriate sizes for all screen types
- **Smooth Animations**: 30-60 FPS for smooth learning experience
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes
